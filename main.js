/***

Account balance history is an array that denotes a monthly track record of 
the balance in someone's account (or simply put how much money they had left that month!
Therefore I assume that the list is always sorted in ascending order.
Only spendings, no savings 

1. Does it solve the basic case?
 Yes, I tested with the basic case.
 
2. What other cases might need to be considered?
 I think it need to be considered negative balance. It is not specified.
 Also I manually tested with null pointer, empty list, 
 list with 2 records and list wiht more than 2 records
 
3. What unit tests might you write for this type of function? 
I would use Mocha unit testing to automate my testing process

Time complexity : O (N) , where N is the number of records in the list
I do not think it can be done faster
